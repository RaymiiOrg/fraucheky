* We should support enabling fraucheky again

  rom_var is currently two byte variable.

  When it's a page of flash ROM, it will be possible
  to enable fraucheky again by erasing the page.

  Define standard vendor specific control command
  for that.


* Many things are hard wired

At configure time, following macro and constants in disk-on-rom.c
should be generated.

    GPL_SECTOR_SIZE
    README_SECTOR_SIZE
    INDEX_SECTOR_SIZE

    d0_fat0_sector
    d0_rootdir_sector


* sharing usb-msc.c implementation for other purpose
  (like pin-dnd.c in Gnuk)


* Device on external chip
